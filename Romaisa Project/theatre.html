        <h2><b>English Renaissance Theatre</b></h2>
        <p id= "para2">English Renaissance theatre, also known as early modern English theatre, or (commonly) as Elizabethan theatre, refers to the theatre of England between 1562 and 1642.English companies even toured and performed English plays abroad, e.g. in Germany and in Denmark.

            The period starts before the establishment of the first permanent theatres. Initially two types of location were used for performing plays, the courtyards of inns and the Inns of Court such as the Inner Temple. These venues continued to be used even after permanent theatres were established.
            
            The first permanent English theatre, the ‘Red Lion’ opened in 1567 but it was a short-lived failure. The first successful theatres, such as The Theatre, opened in 1576.The establishment of large and profitable public theatres was an essential enabling factor in the success of English Renaissance drama.The playhouses were generally built with timber and plaster, and were three stories high. Individual theatre descriptions give additional information to their construction, such as flint stones being used to build the Swan. Theatres were also constructed to be able to hold large amounts of people.Around 1580, when both the Theatre and the Curtain were full on summer days, the total theatre capacity of London was about 5000 spectators. With the building of new theatre facilities and the formation of new companies, the capital’s total theatre capacity exceeded 10,000 after 1610.

            This is the style of the plays of William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe andBen Jonson.</p>

            <h3><b>Best Theatre Actors</b></h3>
            <h4><b>James Earl Jones <img src="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/i?id=65a23abd382cddb28e1d4dceb54a6be41173ecbe-10906089-images-thumbs&n=13" alt="" id="img2"></b> </h4>
            <p id= "para2">Living legend James Earl Jones is best known as the voice actor for Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise, as well as the murdered king in one of Shakespeare’s greatest film adaptations of Hamlet. While his voice is instantly recognisable and his film credits are extensive, Jones is also regarded as one of the world’s greatest stage actors. He debuted on Broadway in 1957, distinguishing himself as a Shakespearean actor. However, his work in theatre has continued through to this day—earning him three Tony Awards and countless other accolades. In 2022, the Manhattan-based James Earl Jones Theatre was renamed in his honour.  </p>
            <h4><b>Tom Hiddleston <img src="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/i?id=478206b17894419f2ba4ab315815fcdd299ec08c-8316779-images-thumbs&n=13"  alt="" id="img2"></b></h4>
            <p id= "para2">Tom Hiddleston is one of those actors who seemingly exploded over the last ten-or-so years, and has never looked back. All things Loki aside, Hiddleston spent the first decade of his career working on stage; despite his meteoric rise, he still finds time to take on fascinating and complex theatre roles—including a lauded run as Hamlet in 2017 directed by Kenneth Branagh. Hiddleston only made his Broadway debut in 2019, so it’s safe to say we have many years ahead of us to catch his brilliance in person.</p>
            <h4><b>Viola Davis <img src="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/i?id=d3708b30b18063562f670639aa06cb0465e97416-10841731-images-thumbs&n=13" alt="" id="img2"></b></h4>
            <p id= "para2">There are few actors working today with quite so much clout and respect as Viola Davis. In the 1990’s and 2000’s, she rose to the top of the theatre world, earning both an Obie and Tony Award within two years of each other. Her early film and television career was solid, although her breakout was 2008’s Doubt, for which she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Davis is one of the most recognised and decorated actors in the business—as of the writing of this article, she has achieved the extremely rare EGOT status. And while her continuing work in several film franchises keeps her from stage work, we can only hope she’ll return to her roots in the future.</p>
            <h4><b>Simon Russell Beale <img src="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/i?id=b0be4334988cce679ed415ac664329924c68796c-10967292-images-thumbs&n=13" alt="" id="img2"></b></h4>
            <p id= "para2">Ask an actor who their favourite stage performers are, and there’s a good chance they’ll mention Simon Russell Beale. Beale has been acting in film and television since the 1990’s, however he is best known and loved as one of theatre’s champions in the modern age. He spent his early career working with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), where he met frequent collaborator Sam Mendes. Since the 1990’s, Beale is most commonly associated with the National Theatre, contributing some truly iconic performances across every conceivable genre. There are many clips of his stage work online; below, we’ve opted to include one of the many instances of him talking about and exploring his craft.</p>
            <h4><b>Sir Ian McKellen <img src="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/i?id=95fdd9eca4820bb8392ba13dc645d56c2328a9be-7952541-images-thumbs&n=13" alt="" id="img2"></b></h4>
            <p id= "para2">Sir Ian McKellen has enjoyed a long, prosperous career in both stage and screen. Best known for his portrayal of Gandalf the Grey in The Lord of the Rings and as Magneto in the X-Men series of films, McKellen has not let his Hollywood success keep him from stages in England and America. His stage credits have continued to accrue with consistency; they include standards such as a 2017 production of King Lear (available via National Theatre’s online portal), but also less conventional choices such as an age-blind production of Hamlet that saw him return to the title role for the first time in fifty years.</p>
